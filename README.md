# 2023 NASA Openscapes Champions Cohort 

Welcome to the 2023 NASA Openscapes Champions Cohort! This is a Cohort for research teams using NASA Earthdata to learn open science practices and spend time experimenting and planning what their analytical workflows with NASA Earthdata look like in the Cloud. This is part of NASA Openscapes: <https://nasa-openscapes.github.io>. Learn more about Openscapes and the Champions Program: <https://openscapes.org>.

## Coworking times (optional)

Coworking sessions are where we work at the same time together. Sometimes, this means quiet work with check-ins to break up focused work and get feedback, and sometimes this involves asking questions and screensharing to learn and problem solve. Coworking in the weeks between Cohort Calls - May 11, 25, June 8. 10-11:30 PT - alternating Thursdays.
